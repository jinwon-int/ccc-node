# Bridge operations

The Telegram bridge connects Telegram to Claude Code for a selected project path. It is a ccc-node app layer, separate from Hermes Gateway, A2A broker, DB/replay flows, and provider canaries.

## Start and status

- Start foreground: `bridge/start.sh --path <project>`
- Start daemon supervisor: `bridge/start.sh --path <project> -d`
- Status: `bridge/start.sh --path <project> --status`
- Stop: `bridge/start.sh --path <project> --stop`

On Linux production nodes, prefer the node's scoped `ccc-telegram-bridge.service` where configured. On Termux, avoid systemd assumptions and verify both the supervisor and `python -m telegram_bot` child.

## Safety boundaries

- Do not print bot tokens, owner chat IDs, provider keys, session files, or raw update payloads.
- Restart only the ccc bridge runtime when the change is bridge-scoped; do not restart Hermes Gateway or A2A broker as part of a bridge rollout.
- Treat Telegram/provider canaries as separate approval-gated actions.

## Health evidence

Useful non-secret evidence is service state, PID, restart count, `health.json` state, recent redacted warning/error classes, source commit, and test output.
